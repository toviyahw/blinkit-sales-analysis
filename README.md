# Blinket-Sales

## Project Plan: Sales Data Analysis Using Python + SQLÂ¶
## Purpose
This project aims to analyze sales data to uncover trends, optimize inventory management, and evaluate marketing effectiveness. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy, we will explore patterns in order performance, delivery efficiency, and inventory levels, leading to actionable business insights.

## Methods
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Load and inspect the datasets using Pandas.
Handle missing values and inconsistent data entries.
Convert categorical data into appropriate formats.
Merge relevant datasets to create a unified view for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Generate summary statistics for key numerical and categorical variables.
Analyze sales distribution and seasonal trends.
Identify top-selling and least-selling products.
Investigate correlations between pricing, sales volume, and marketing efforts.
4. Data Visualization:
Create bar charts and histograms to show sales trends across different categories.
Develop time-series plots to analyze seasonal patterns in sales.
Use heatmaps to identify relationships between different features (e.g., sales and marketing spend).
Visualize inventory turnover and stockout trends.
5. Research Questions:
What are the top-selling products and categories based on sales revenue and order volume?
How does pricing impact sales performance?
What is the relationship between marketing spend and sales growth?
How efficient is the delivery process, and what factors influence delivery times?
Are there seasonal patterns in sales, and how do they affect inventory levels?
How can inventory management be optimized to reduce stockouts and overstocking?
6. Tools & Technologies:
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
Jupyter Notebook: For code execution and analysis
SQL (?): Querying structured datasets for deeper insights
Expected Outcomes
A well-structured Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis and visualizations.
Insights into product sales trends, customer purchasing behaviors, and marketing effectiveness.
Data-driven recommendations for improving inventory management and delivery performance.
Well-documented Python and SQL? scripts for reproducibility and future analysis.
